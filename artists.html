						<br>
                        <p>
						Though his heart is his hometown of Ann Arbor, MI, rapper/singer Shane MauX (Belikos, Duk Duk Goose!) has called Brooklyn his home for the better part of a decade.
						Shane's first solo release, the "Come Alive" EP is a departure from his previous projects. As the frontman of rock band Belikos, he played gigs including the Virgin Mobile Free Fest, CMJ, Webster Hall, Brooklyn Night Bazaar, Piano's, The Knitting Factory, Santos Party House, The Bitter End, and the Afro-Punk Festival. He shared bills with legendary artists including Ludacris, Mos Def, Bad Brains, Chromeo, M.I.A., Pavement, LCD Soundsystem, Joan Jett, and Fishbone. As one half of rap duo "Duk Duk Goose!", he played dozens of shows in the NYC Hip Hop scene and released two mix tapes and several videos.

						<br>
                        <p>
						Armed with limitless potential and a fearless mind, Noel Black [aka Young Furio aka King Crow] has relentlessly pursued a life in music. Born on the Caribbean island of Tobago, Mr. Black is undeniably influenced by the island's unique culture and incredible diversity of musical traditions. As a boy, it was dancehall music and the artist Bounty Killer that first dominated his imagination - inspiring him to become an artist in his own right. Then, in 1996, when New York City became home, the irresistible power & energy of hip-hop fueled Brooklyn also has a major impact on his musical evolution. Noel breaks down cultural, racial and social barriers to reach new artistic levels. He created Corvus Entertainment to house artists of promise & collaborators of merit. Click <a style="color:red" href="noel.html">here</a> to listen to Noel's work.
