						From the beautiful island of St. Croix USVI, ArSkip started freestyling for fun until a close friend suggested that he pursue music more seriously. He started writing songs, and dropped his first mixtape - "A Zillion Bars of Pain", hosted b G-Unit DJ Rob E Rob - in 2008. His new single "Why I Came Here" is tearing up clubs in the tri-state area, as well as satellite radio. In 2016, ArSkip will release a series of mixtapes called "Short Drive on a Long Road". He will also be dropping his highly anticipated solo album, which is as yet untitled. His influences include Tupac, Biggie Smalls, A Tribe Called Quest, Bob Marley, Shabba Ranks, Buju Bonton, and Rakim. Click <a style="color:red" href="arskip.html">here</a> to hear ArSkip's work.

						<br>
                        <p>
						Armed with limitless potential and a fearless mind, Noel Black [aka Young Furio aka King Crow] has relentlessly pursued a life in music. Born on the Caribbean island of Tobago, Mr. Black is undeniably influenced by the island's unique culture and incredible diversity of musical traditions. As a boy, it was dancehall music and the artist Bounty Killer that first dominated his imagination - inspiring him to become an artist in his own right. Then, in 1996, when New York City became home, the irresistible power & energy of hip-hop fueled Brooklyn also has a major impact on his musical evolution. Noel breaks down cultural, racial and social barriers to reach new artistic levels. He created Corvus Entertainment to house artists of promise & collaborators of merit.
