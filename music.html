						Cramped in a 10x10 Park Slope, Brooklyn apartment began the relationship that would magnetize Chella and Guill to birth the duo "AGuynAGirl". One hard core rocker and one reggae baby began their journey together in 2009 while attending college and have been gaining the ears of listeners internationally ever since. Their sound is eclectic, while still reminiscent of some rock, reggae and R&B greats - lyrically poised and instrumentally magnificent. Click <a style="color:red" href="aguynagirl.html">here</a> to hear their beautiful melodies.

                        <p>
						From the beautiful island of St. Croix, ArSkip started freestyling for fun until a close friend suggested that he pursue music more seriously. He started writing songs, and dropped his first mixtape - "A Zillion Bars of Pain", hosted b G-Unit DJ Rob E Rob - in 2008. His new single "Why I Came Here" is tearing up clubs in the tri-state area, as well as satellite radio. In 2016, ArSkip will release a series of mixtapes called "Short Drive on a Long Road". He will also be dropping his highly anticipated solo album, which is as yet untitled. His influences include Tupac, Biggie Smalls, A Tribe Called Quest, Bob Marley, Shabba Ranks, Buju Bonton, and Rakim. Click <a style="color:red" href="arskip.html">here</a> to hear ArSkip's work.

						<br>
                        <p>
						Armed with limitless potential and a fearless mind, Noel Black [aka Young Furio aka King Crow] has relentlessly pursued a life in music. Born on the Caribbean island of Tobago, Mr. Black is undeniably influenced by the island's unique culture and incredible diversity of musical traditions. As a boy, it was dancehall music and the artist Bounty Killer that first dominated his imagination - inspiring him to become an artist in his own right. Then, in 1996, when New York City became home, the irresistible power & energy of hip-hop fueled Brooklyn also has a major impact on his musical evolution. Noel breaks down cultural, racial and social barriers to reach new artistic levels. He created Corvus Entertainment to house artists of promise & collaborators of merit.
